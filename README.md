## Update

Version 0.01 was uploaded on 03/14/2021.

## Usage
Download the main presentation file (``main.tex``), the style file ``KobeMetropolis.sty``, and the **figures** folder, and place them in the same directory. You will also need to download the logo files from the university website. Typeset ``main.tex`` using XeLaTeX to produce presentation slides (``main.pdf``).


## Kobe Univeristy Logo

I am not at a liberty to distribute the official logo files of Kobe University. You thus need to obtain these files from the university webpage, or comment out the relevant section in the ``KobeMetropolis.sty`` file and the ``main.tex`` file.


#### Getting the logos

To obtain the logo files, you need to access the [download page](https://www.kobe-u.ac.jp/info/outline/resources/download.html) via Kobe's network (either on campus or using VPN). The template uses the following three files:

1. Basic logo with the transparent background [[direct link](http://www.office.kobe-u.ac.jp/ppr-contents/logo/01_logo_basic/02_logo_clearback.png)]. This file needs to be saved in a directory named **01_logo_basic**, which should be placed under the **figures** directory, which should be located in a directory that stores ``main.tex`` and ``KobeMetropolis.sty``.  
2. Logo combined with English university name with the transparent background [[direct link](http://www.office.kobe-u.ac.jp/ppr-contents/logo/01_logo_basic/10_set_en_clearback.png)]. This file needs to be saved in the same directory as above (``figures/01_logo_basic/``).  
3. White logo combined with English university name with the transparent background [[direct link](http://www.office.kobe-u.ac.jp/ppr-contents/logo/04_logo_white/10_set_en_clearback.png)]. This file needs to be saved in a directory named **04_logo_white**, which should be placed under the **figures** directory.
